# hritvik-Otel
All files containing my Open Telemetry journey.

Future Plans with Otel:

1) Configure and Practice Docker more,
2) Will enhance JS(NodeJS and TypeScript) more, (will work on any language that will be suggested and supported by Open Telemetry)
3) Will enhance my efficiency in using analysis tools like zipkin or Jaegar.
